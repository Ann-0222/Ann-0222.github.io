# How to work in different environment.
```
$ hugo new SITE-NAME
$ cd SITE-NAME
$ git clone git@github.com:tempKDW/tempkdw.github.io.git
```

* Without `hugo new SITE-NAME`, it will not work properly. Even if you cloned a code from git.

# local test run
```
$ hugo server
```

# build for production
```
$ hugo
```
